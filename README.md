# 💀 Rahmerh's dotfiles

`What can I say, I like skulls...`

## ⚙️ Installation

If you just want to get started, execute the following:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Rahmerh/dotfiles.git && cd ./dotfiles/ && ./install
```

The install script is designed to be re-run multiple times, so in case you want to make your changes just run `./install` again.

You can also clone this script to any directory you want. It will only create symlinks for all needed configurations.

Be warned, these dotfiles have only been tested on MacOS at the time of writing. I am planning to include a linux install script as well.

### ⚠️ Warning in advance

I am constantly pushing to this repository, so **no** guarantees any stability!
