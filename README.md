# Rahmerh's dotfiles

## Installation

My dotfiles I want to have anywhere I want. I like arch so keep that in mind while using this repo.

Recently I moved back to windows for work and general compatibility for video games. I've lazily put my linux files in a linux folder and started a windows folder.

### Windows setup
WIP

**I am using [this](https://github.com/JMOrbegoso/Dotfiles-for-Windows-11) repo as inspiration, please check it out since it's much better than mine.**

### Linux setup

I've included an install script to easily get set up. If you want to live on the edge and directly install execute the following:

```shell
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Rahmerh/dotfiles/main/linux/auto-setup.sh)"
```

Note that the auto setup only needs to be executed once, after setting up the fish shell you can use the `apply.fish` script to apply the dotfiles.

### Warning in advance

I am constantly pushing to this repository, so **no** guarantees any stability!
