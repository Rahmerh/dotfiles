# Rahmerh's dotfiles

## ⚙️ Installation

Setting up is fairly easy, simply clone this repo and run the `install` script.

Be warned, these dotfiles have only been tested on MacOS at the time of writing. I am planning to include a linux install script as well.

## 📝 Used tools

I install all my applications and tools using brew. The following are the most important tools I work with:

- [Kitty](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty) terminal (with the [fish](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell) shell)
- [Spotify tui](https://github.com/Rigellute/spotify-tui)
